# Use TDD principles to build out name functionality for a Person.
# Here are the requirements:
# - Add a method to return the full name as a string. A full name includes
#   first, middle, and last name. If the middle name is missing, there shouldn't
#   have extra spaces.
# - Add a method to return a full name with a middle initial. If the middle name
#   is missing, there shouldn't be extra spaces or a period.
# - Add a method to return all initials. If the middle name is missing, the
#   initials should only have two characters.
#
# We've already sketched out the spec descriptions for the #full_name. Try
# building the specs for that method, watch them fail, then write the code to
# make them pass. Then move on to the other two methods, but this time you'll
# create the descriptions to match the requirements above.
